PostUp Cards lets the user build their own deck of virtual NBA player cards that they can access anytime.

# User Story
--------------------------------------
As a kid, I used to love collecting sports cards. You could look at your favourite players stats quickly and have that info close at hand. However, a card collection takes space and is hard to keep with you at all times. What if you could create a digital form of sports cards made to your specific request?
