<p align="center">Virtual Card Collecting Fun!</p>



# Pitch
--------------------------------------
PostUp Cards lets the user build their own deck of virtual NBA player cards that they can access online.

# User Story
--------------------------------------
As a kid, I used to love collecting sports cards. You could look at your favourite players stats quickly and have that info close at hand. However, a card collection takes space and is hard to keep with you at all times. What if you could create a digital form of sports cards made to your specific request?

# Overview
---------------------------------------

This application uses [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction) to retrieve the selected player's season stats and [giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/) to post a GIF of that player on the virtual card. The user's cards are then saved in their deck via an SQL database.

# User Directions
-----------------------------------------
* The user enters the desired player's name in the search box and clicks on search.
* The user then decides whether to add the card to their "Deck" by clicking on "Save Card" or clicking on "Clear" to clear card field and start a new search.
* The user clicks on "View/Refresh Deck" in order to view their "Deck" and to reload the "Deck" when a new card is added.
